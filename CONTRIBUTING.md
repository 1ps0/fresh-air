# Contributing to Fresh Air (LLM-First Approach)

We welcome contributions to Fresh Air! This project embraces an LLM-first development philosophy, meaning that Large Language Models (LLMs) are encouraged as powerful tools in the development process. However, it's crucial to understand the responsibilities that come with this approach.

## Your Responsibility

**As a contributor, you are ultimately responsible for every line of code you submit, regardless of its origin.** This includes, but is not limited to, code generated by LLMs.

Before submitting any code, especially LLM-generated code, you **must**:

1.  **Understand the Code**: Fully comprehend what the code does, how it works, and its implications.
2.  **Verify Correctness**: Rigorously test the code to ensure it functions as expected and does not introduce bugs.
3.  **Ensure Quality**: Check for code style, readability, maintainability, and adherence to existing project patterns.
4.  **Security Review**: Be mindful of potential security vulnerabilities introduced by the code.
5.  **License Compliance**: Ensure that any LLM-generated code does not violate licensing terms or introduce proprietary code into the open-source project without proper attribution/permission.
6.  **Human Review**: Treat LLM-generated code as a first draft. It often requires significant human refinement, optimization, and error correction.

## How to Contribute (LLM-Assisted)

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the Fresh Air repository to your GitHub account.
2.  **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fresh-air.git
    cd fresh-air
    ```
3.  **Create a New Branch**: Always work on a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-awesome-feature
    ```
4.  **Develop with LLM Assistance**: Use your preferred LLM (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot) to assist with:
    *   Generating boilerplate code.
    *   Suggesting algorithms or data structures.
    *   Refactoring existing code.
    *   Writing documentation or comments.
    *   Generating tests.
5.  **Review and Refine**: This is the most critical step. Do not blindly copy and paste. Thoroughly review, test, and refine all LLM-generated code to meet the project's standards and your understanding of the requirements.
6.  **Commit Your Changes**: Once you are confident in your changes, commit them with clear and concise messages.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add [brief description of your feature]"
    ```
7.  **Push to Your Fork**: Push your branch to your forked repository.
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-awesome-feature
    ```
8.  **Open a Pull Request (PR)**: Go to the original Fresh Air repository on GitHub and open a pull request from your branch. Provide a detailed description of your changes.
